# Smart Task Analyzer

A full-stack app that stores tasks in MySQL Database and intelligently suggests the top 3 tasks to focus on today — with clear “Critical Thinking” explanations for each pick. Frontend is React + Tailwind; backend is Django/Python; database is MySQL.

## Setup instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Node.js 18+
- MySQL Database 8.0+

### Backend (Django + MySQL)

1. clone smart-task-analyzer repository
2. cd smart-task-analyzer
2. cd backend
4. python -m venv venv
5. venv\Scripts\activate
6. pip install -r requirements.txt
7. Create `.env` in backend with:
   ```env
   DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=your-dev-secret
   DB_NAME=taskdb
   MYSQL_USER=your-mysql-user
   MYSQL_PASSWORD=your-mysql-password
   MYSQL_HOST=your-mysql-host
   MYSQL_PORT=your-mysql-port
   ```
8. python manage.py migrate
9. python manage.py runserver (starts at http://127.0.0.1:8000)

### Frontend (React + Tailwind)

1. cd smart-task-analyzer
2. cd frontend
3. npm install
4. npm run dev (starts at http://localhost:5173)

## Algorithm explanation

The priority scoring combines four factors to mirror practical decision-making:

1. **Urgency**: We convert the due_date to a date object and compare it against today. If the task is overdue, we add a strong bonus (`+20`). If it’s upcoming, we compute days remaining and add up to `+10` for near-term deadlines (e.g., due within 0–10 days). This ensures looming work rises to the top.

2. **Importance**: Importance is directly multiplied by 2, so higher-impact tasks sharply influence ranking. For example, importance 8 contributes `+16`, pushing critical work forward even if deadlines are not immediate.

3. **Effort (Quick Wins)**: We add `10 - estimated_hours` (but not below 0). This favors tasks that can be completed quickly (≤ 3 hours). Quick wins help build momentum and clear mental load — critical when many items compete for attention.

4. **Dependencies**: If a task has dependencies (work that will unblock other tasks), we add `+5`. This nudges sequence-critical work up the list, improving throughput across the whole task set.

The final score is the sum of these components, enabling a balanced view between urgent, important, low-effort, and dependency-unblocking tasks. Explanations are generated by inspecting the same attributes: overdue or near deadline, high importance thresholds (≥ 8 or ≥ 6), quick-win effort (≤ 3 hours), and presence of dependencies. This creates transparent, human-readable reasons that align with the numeric score.

## Design decisions

- MySQL chosen for stability and Django compatibility.
- JSONField used for dependencies (requires MySQL 8+).
- Strategy parameter allows multiple prioritization modes.
- TailwindCSS for utility-first styling.
- Components split into `TaskForm`, `TaskList`, `StrategyToggle`, `AllTask` `Suggestions` for clarity.
- State managed with React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`).

## Time breakdown

- Backend models, scoring, serializers, views, URLs: ~7.5 hours
- CORS + environment setup + settings: ~0.5 hour
- Frontend React components (form, list, strategy, fetch): ~1.5 hours
- Integration, testing, and fixes (date parsing, error handling): ~2 hour
- README and documentation: ~0.5 hour

Total: ~12+ hours

## Future improvements

- Configurable scoring weights per user
- User authentication & per-user task lists
- Calendar integration (Google/Outlook)
- Dependency graph visualization
- Observability (logging, metrics, tracing)
- Add authentication (per-user tasks)
- Better error handling & loading states
- Responsive charts for task distribution
- Drag-and-drop task reordering
- Offline mode with local storage
